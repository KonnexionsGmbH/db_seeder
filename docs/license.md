   This license governs use of the accompanying software. If you use the software, you 
   accept this license. If you do not accept the license, do not use the software.

   1. Definitions.

      The terms "reproduce", "reproduction", "derivative works", and "distribution" 
      have the same meaning here as under U.S. copyright law.
        
      A "contribution" is the original software, or any additions or changes to the 
      software.
        
      A "contributor" is any person that distributes its contribution under this 
      license.
        
      "Licensed patents" are a contributor's patent claims that read directly on its 
      contribution.

   2. Grant of Rights

      (a)  Copyright Grant- Subject to the terms of this license, including the license 
           conditions and limitations in section 3, each contributor grants you a non-
           exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to reproduce its 
           contribution, prepare derivative works of its contribution, and distribute 
           its contribution or any derivative works that you create.

      (b)  Patent Grant- Subject to the terms of this license, including the license 
           conditions and limitations in section 3, each contributor grants you a non-
           exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free license under its licensed patents to 
           make, have made, use, sell, offer for sale, import, and/or otherwise dispose
           of its contribution in the software or derivative works of the contribution 
           in the software.

   3. Conditions and Limitations

      (a)  No Trademark License- This license does not grant you rights to use any 
           contributors' name, logo, or trademarks.

      (b)  If you bring a patent claim against any contributor over patents that you 
           claim are infringed by the software, your patent license from such 
           contributor to the software ends automatically.0

      (c)  If you distribute any portion of the software, you must retain all copyright, 
           patent, trademark, and attribution notices that are present in the software.

      (d)  If you distribute any portion of the software in source code form, you may do
           so only under this license by including a complete copy of this license with 
           your distribution. If you distribute any portion of the software in compiled 
           or object code form, you may only do so under a license that complies with 
           this license.

      (e)  The software is licensed "as-is." You bear the risk of using it. The 
           contributors give no express warranties, guarantees or conditions. You may 
           have additional consumer rights under your local laws which this license 
           cannot change. To the extent permitted under your local laws, the 
           contributors exclude the implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a
           particular purpose and non-infringement.

      (f)  Source code usage under this License is limited to review, compilation and 
           contributions. Contributions to Konnexions software products under this 
           License may only be made in consultation with Konnexions GmbH and through the
           appropriate Konnexions software repositories.
